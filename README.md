# what is wifi hacking ?
Wifi hacking or wifi pentest i basicaly a **"illegal"** way to connect into a secured wifi by cracking it's passcode .

# Why do hackers prefer hacking wifi networks and not use they're own ones ?

it's pretty easy when a hacker is pentesting something he wants to be hidden and secured , when surfing the internet so they prefer to not use they're own network and use someone else WiFi making them able to be **"secured"** 

# what is a network ?
A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

# What are types ?
## LAN :
**Local Area Network** A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building.
## WAN :
**Wide Area Network** Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Florida, the United States, or the world. Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite uplinks may be used to connect this type of global network.

# what are the commun ways used by hackers to hack Wifi networks ?

# MITM or Evil twin attack
MITM or Man In The Middle attack is a commun methode used by hackers to hack wifi networks it consist of making a fake AP with the same network name as the "target" name and deauthing all the networks users , so when they try to connect back to wifi a password is required when it's typed the hacker gain it and gain acces to network The tool used in this method is **LYNSET**

# What is "WPS" ?
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature supplied with many routers. It is designed to make the process of connecting to a secure wireless network from a computer or other device easier.

## How to enable WPS on a router ?

## WPS vulnerability
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) provides simplified mechanisms to configure secure wireless networks. The external registrar PIN exchange mechanism is susceptible to brute-force attacks that could allow an attacker to gain access to an encrypted Wi-Fi network.
WPS uses a PIN as a shared secret to authenticate an access point and a client and provide connection information such as WEP and WPA passwords and keys. In the external registrar exchange method, a client needs to provide the correct PIN to the access point.

An attacking client can try to guess the correct PIN. A design vulnerability reduces the effective PIN space sufficiently to allow practical brute force attacks. Freely available attack tools can recover a WPS PIN in 4-10 hours.
